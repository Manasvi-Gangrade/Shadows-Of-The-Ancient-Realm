**Shadows of the Ancient Realm**

Shadows of the Ancient Realm is a third-person action-mystery game inspired by Indian folklore and mythological creatures. Explore corrupted realms, face reimagined Rakshasas, Vetalas, Yakshas, and other legendary beings, and unlock adaptive mythic powers with each victory.

**The game combines:**
1. Fast-paced combat with fluid melee combos and mystical abilities
2. Mystery-driven exploration with hidden lore, environmental puzzles, and artifacts
3. Stylized Indian art aesthetics blending Warli, Gond, Madhubani, and Mandala motifs
4. Scalable multiplayer modes including co-op exploration, boss hunts, and competitive PvP duels
5. Players craft their unique combat identity by absorbing powers from defeated bosses while experiencing a globally appealing, culturally rich adventure that celebrates Indian storytelling in a modern, interactive form.
